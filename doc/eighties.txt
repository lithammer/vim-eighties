		Eighties color scheme

Eighties, a color scheme with a unique touch.

==============================================================================
Color scheme options					eighties-options*

						*g:eighties_transp_bg*
Set to 1 if you want a transparent background. Takes effect only in the
terminal.
>
	let g:eighties_transp_bg = 0
<

						*g:eighties_italics*
Set to 0 if you do not want to enable italics. Note that the color scheme in
normal circumstances automatically detects whether italics is available. You
should never need to set this option explicitly. You may want to unset it if
you do not want Vim to display italics even when the feature is available
(e.g., in GUI versions of Vim).
>
	let g:eighties_italics = 1
<

						*g:eighties_italicize_strings*
Set to 0 if you do not want strings in italics.
>
	let g:eighties_italicize_strings = 1
